# Project Notes

I'm currently trying to answer a couple different questions with this repository.
Here they are in no particular order:

- How quickly are maintainers responding to pull requests and issues?
- How long does it take to merge a pull request?
    - This should be broken down by pull request size measured as lines changed
- How long does it take to resolve an issue?
- How many issues are closed by the stale bot versus maintainers?
- How many active contributors are there?
    - What is an "active contributor"?

## Who are the maintainers?

One of the underlying things I need to figure out is who the maintainers
actually are. This can be a little tricky to figure out as it changes over
time. It might make the most sense to just stick with whoever currently has
merge rights for the repository and not worry about the history of the repository.

I think the best way to handle this in the application is to have users manually
add this information themselves. This will need to be a done on a per project
basis because each project can have a different list of maintainers.
